          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>Yes I have some experience. I have completed quite a few programming courses during my Bechelor of IT as well as studying Java outside of university as it is a language I very much enjoy. I have previously worked through both recommended textbooks a few years ago before starting this degree as well but my design knowledge is limited.</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>I view myself as a programmer but enjoy design immensly and would love to be able to become better at design to feel competent in both.</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>I'm redoing this course after dropping the subject previously while on the way to completing my Bachelor in IT. The reason for studying through RMIT online is due to moving to the UK during my studies.</div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>I am hoping to further my understanding of web programming and to become a better learner. My end goals are to build a solid foundation for future courses and to explore different topics I might enjoy.</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>I find myself using a lot of differene websites throughout the day. However, my most commonly used ones are reddit.com, youtube.com, twitch.com, reuters.com and gmail.com</div>

        <p>Dear Mr Baker, </p><br>
        <p>After undertaking initial observations of your website I have prepared a proposal for the redevelopment of <a href="https://www.sites.google.com/site/anzacdouglasraymondbaker/">https://www.sites.google.com/site/anzacdouglasraymondbaker/</a></p>
        <p>Within the proposal I have outlined the key changes that should be made to attract and continue engaging users with your content. Changes that should be made include:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>structural changes to the website</li>
          <li>a cohesive colour scheme that is inviting and modern</li>
          <li>user friendly layout of content</li>
          <li>simpler navigation</li>
          <li>updating old code to newer versions </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Currently, your website makes good use of displaying the content it has in easy to read pages that allows users to focus solely on the content in front of them. You also have a search function that is incredibly beneficial to the end user who seeks to find exactly what they are looking for in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>The changes I would like to take to improve upon the good aspects of your website would entail a few things.</p>
        <p><b>Code update</b></p>
        <p>Updating your website's current version of code will mean that old, redundant features and code will be removed, this will allow future updates to be done swiftly and easily. It will also allow for a more streamlined process when altering content within your website if another developer or yourself decides to apply updates</p>
        <p>Updating your website's current version of code will mean that old, redundant features and code will be removed, this will allow future updates to be done swiftly and easily. It will also allow for a more streamlined process when altering content within your website if another developer or yourself decides to apply updates. I will also be changing some code that is not intuitive for search engines and to make it clearer for any future development to find the respective code in the correct places</p>
        <p><b>Structural changes and creating a user friendly layout</b></p>
        <p>I aim to make a few changes with the structure of some pages, moving the navigation bar to the top of the page, altering the footer so that all relevant contact and privacy information can be found on each page in its logical location. Aligning content correctly so it becomes easier to consume and understand for the end user. Combining certain pages with relevant information but creating breaks to indicate a new section of content. Organising text and images correctly throughout multiple pages so that there will be a template to follow for future pages that are content heavy. Moving the search bar into the header itself will allow it to move with the page and not move onto content when screen sizes change.</p>
        <p><b>Colour scheme changes</b></p>
        <p>Altering the background colour and creating a greater contrast between the colours used makes the website more visually appealing while keeping the historic theme throughout the website. Complementary tones would be chosen to ensure the website continues to employ a certain feel about it while being modern and clean.</p>
        <p><b>Intuitive navigation</b></p>
        <p>Creating an intuitive navigation bar with drop down menus will make it easier for the end user to find the pages they want to visit. To do this I will combine some similar pages and create smaller drop down menus for topics such as the year of battle. This will ensure a better user experience when navigating the entire website.</p><br>
        <p>I hope this plan effectively outlined the changes I wish to make to your current website, if there are further changes you would like to discuss please contact me further.</p>
        <p>Kind regards,</p>
        <p>Alanna</p>
