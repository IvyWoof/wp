          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>Yes I have some experience. I have completed quite a few programming courses during my Bechelor of IT as well as studying Java outside of university as it is a language I very much enjoy. I have previously worked through both recommended textbooks a few years ago before starting this degree as well but my design knowledge is limited.</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>I view myself as a programmer but enjoy design immensly and would love to be able to become better at design to feel competent in both.</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>I'm redoing this course after dropping the subject previously while on the way to completing my Bachelor in IT. The reason for studying through RMIT online is due to moving to the UK during my studies.</div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>I am hoping to further my understanding of web programming and to become a better learner. My end goals are to build a solid foundation for future courses and to explore different topics I might enjoy.</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>I find myself using a lot of differene websites throughout the day. However, my most commonly used ones are reddit.com, youtube.com, twitch.com, reuters.com and gmail.com</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>Of course! I enjoy swimming, photography, traveling, gardening and going out to nice restuarants on the weekend.</div>
