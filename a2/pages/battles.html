                <h2>An Account of the Gallipoli Landing</h2>
                <img src="/../../../media/gallipoli-landing.jpg">
                <h3>Fort Tigne Hospital, Malta, May 4th 1915</h3>
                <p>Dear Mother,</p>
                <p>Now that we are resting after the horrors and hardships of a few days in the “Big Push” I must try and tell you some of the news.  I have sent several “field cards” and one or two short letters and hope they reached you safely.</p>
                <p>Starting from where I left off after having breakfast near Beauval, we marched on through Bonneville and billeted at the village of Halloy-Pernois, altogether a 13 mile march.  At 10.30 a.m. the next day we again started off, passed the village of Havernas and billeted at Naours, this day only a five mile tramp.  At Naours we stopped for four days having a quiet time, while there we visited some famous Catacombs less than half a mile from our billet and found them very interesting.  It was much like being down a mine only the entrance is at the base of a big hill.  These Catacombs are supposed to be 550 years old and were once chalk pits, there are passages, tunnels, dug-outs, traverses, stairways, airshafts, and ups and downs in all directions and it would be easy to get lost.  In different places there are relics of all sorts behind wire netting and bars, statues of Christ on the Cross, brass candlesticks, Virgin Mary, etc..  All over the walls persons have written their names and we saw John Norton’s who edited the “Sunday Truth”, underneath he had added “Sydney, Australia”, our guide pointed it out to us.</p>
                <p>At midday Sunday, July 16th we moved out of Naours, marched through Palmas village and billeted at a large farm on the outskirts of Rubempre.  As usual we were put into the barn to sleep and as it had been a long march we were glad to rest in the straw.  At this place food was not too plentiful, that is, other than the ordinary army rations, and one or two chaps bought all there was, leaving many of us with money in our pockets and empty tummies.  Our Sergeant was one of the lucky ones, but was foolish enough to go out and leave a hat full of cakes on his bunk and you know “opportunity makes the -----“   but I set fair exchange example by taking two cakes and putting 2 pennies in the hat and was promptly followed by others so that in about “two ups” there were more pennies than cakes.  I must draw a veil over the rest of the tale – poor Sergeant Scott.  We were two nights at this farm and then again started "foot slogging", the villages we passed through were – Herrincort, Toutencourt, Harponville and Varennes, and we stopped at Hedauville for the night.</p>
                <p>The next day our packs were collected and stowed away and we left Hedauville carrying only overcoat and oilsheet, so we knew that we were getting nearer the fray.  The whole of the 3rd Brigade were on the move and our Company rested on the outskirts of “Boozincourt” while all the Battalions marched past.  It was a great sight and you would have thought the men were going to a picnic instead of into the thickest of the fighting on the whole British Line.  That same afternoon we marched through the town of Albert and bivouaced a few hundred yards the other side. Albert is a fine large city, now almost empty of civilians and has been knocked about muchly by the Huns’ shells, especially the cathedral.  On the top of the spire is a large gilded figure of the Virgin Mary holding in her arms the form of Christ as a child.  Originally it pointed to the sky but owing to the effect of the German shells it is now leaning over at right angles – the figure itself being uninjured and it appears as if Christ was being offered to the people.  It presents a strange and curious sight, especially when standing directly underneath – to see this overhanging image a couple of hundred feet up. You may have heard of it or seen a photo of it.</p>
                <p>That night I was one of a party of twelve to go up to the firing line with some of the Coy’s gear.  It was a long and weary tramp, but we eventually, after being lost several times, found our way to Contalmaison where we left the stuff and got back to camp at 6 a.m. next morning.  I managed to get a few hours sleep and in the afternoon we all packed up and moved up as far as the old British firing line, from where the “Big Push” started.  This was Thursday, July 20th.  Here we slept for two nights and spent most of our time exploring the German’s old firing line and dug outs – the latter being in some cases 30 feet (9+ metres) underground and well furnished.  Judging by the state of the trenches and the ground round about, the Germans must have had a very hot time – their barb-wire was torn to shreds, parapets levelled to the ground, enormous shell holes overlapping each other and equipment and stores strewn everywhere in hopeless confusion.  The Pioneers and Salvage Corps had not had time to attend their work so we noticed many dead Huns about , some half buried under the ruins of their trenches, others in the open and here and there a leg or an arm sticking out of a smashed dug out.</p>
                <p>On the Saturday afternoon, after handing in our overcoats, we started for the firing line, the waggons taking our gear part of the way.  We had to carry it the rest and for nearly three hours we toiled along through communication trenches.  It was deadly work and everyone swore it was the worst time they ever had, in fact one of our chaps [Bob Wood] fainted from exhaustion.  The way was new to us, the night was dark, in places we were up to our knees in mud, had to walk over dead men and just got in to be told to get our guns in position as the attack was to start in 15 mins.  I must not tell you, dear Mother, all the horrors of that night, it would sicken you – Gallipoli was a home in comparison and for the following few days and nights it was fast and furious, attack and counter attack, dead, dying and wounded lying about, no possibility of sleep; it was indeed a shambles but how gloriously our men fought and how nobly the stretcher-bearers worked.  Many prisoners were brought in and they looked scared out of their lives.</p>
                <p>The “Big Push” is good to read of but to be in it is Hell and yet I am glad to be able to say I was there and never shirked.  Our Company suffered severely as did all the Batts. in the 1st Division.  What a great relief it was to us when we came out, both physically and mentally exhausted – the nerves of many were completely gone – it was pitiful to see big men collapse and cry like babies; we were all rather shakey but it was nothing to be ashamed of for it was a great test of human endurance.  We can look back at it now and feel glad that we were successful and we feel that next time we will do equally as well – it cannot be worse anyway,  Now we are having a good rest and I am in good health, eating like a horse and feeling fit for anything.</p>
                <p>All I have to worry about is how the dear ones at home are getting on.  Our march back from the fray was done in easy stages, via Albert, Warloy-Baillon, Vadencourt, Toulencourt, Herrisart,  Val De Maison, Naours, Halloy to Berthancourt.  I received a letter from you dated end of May yesterday, it was very welcome, glad you got the parcels I sent and hope the money is alright.  Remember me to T.W., he has my sympathy [3 oh lor].(probably the birth of his third child, oh Lord!). Will write again soon, hope you get this alright. </p>
                <p>Best of love, dearest of Mothers, from your loving son,</p>
                <p>Ray</p>
