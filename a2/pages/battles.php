                <h3>Fort Tigne Hospital, Malta, May 4th 1915</h3>
                <p>Dear Mother,</p>
                <p>About six hundred of Australian wounded [including myself] have arrived at the above address and all are in good spirits.  Of course those who were very severely wounded were left at Alexandria and there was a great number of them too.  But I believe I am starting at the wrong end, so will go back a little over a week when we were on board the “Malda” in Lemnos Island Harbour. I could go back even further than that to the time when we left Mena Camp [Feb. 28th] and sailed by the troopship “Ionian” to Lemnos Island, of our five weeks under canvas there and all our experiences, etc.;  but I am afraid it would take too long and at present there is plenty of later news to write about.</p>
                <p>Well, to resume my story – we were on board the Troopship “Malda” on Saturday, April 24th, waiting for British destroyers to take us to the place where we were to land and meet the Turks.  At 10 p.m. we had our last meal on the “Malda” and somewhere about midnight, two destroyers came alongside and we were immediately transhipped to them.  Previously to this though, the “Malda” had left Lemnos Harbour with us and taken a few hours trip to some place unknown.  It was at this place that the destroyers joined us and our Company went on board the “Colne” and we steamed away from the “Malda” in the direction of the Dardanelles. We were all crowded on the deck, quite comfortable, and at 3 a.m. hot cocoa was served out to all hands.  About this time the “Colne” stopped and it was 4.30 a.m. before she moved on again.  We had not gone far before land could be seen ahead and we all then got into small boats which were alongside.  The order was given to push off and make for land, just as day was beginning to break.  The oarsmen gave way with a will and we were still 100 yards from shore when the exciting times commenced.  There were six boat-loads of us and many others from other destroyers and cruisers all making for the shore at once.</p>
                <p>The Turks must have been expecting us for their bullets began to fly all round the boats.  Luckily not one in our boat was hit but others did not get off so well, for one fellow was killed and many were wounded.  When our boat grounded we jumped out, almost up to the hips in water and made for the shore.  It was my luck to step into a hole and I went almost under water, getting my rifle wet, but I managed to get to land otherwise unhurt.  George Thomas was with us and gave the order to  “Fix bayonets, open out and advance.”  Ahead of us was a steep hill covered with thick undergrowth from 2 feet to 5 feet high and forming excellent cover for the enemy and also ourselves, but not bullet-proof.  We got to the top of the first hill, about 100 feet high, in quick time and without mishap, the Turks retreating before us as we advanced.  Ahead of us as far as we could see the country was all hills and gullies covered with the same thick undergrowth.</p>
                <p>It was now broad daylight and as we forged onward an occasional bullet would whiz past unpledasantly close, but the enemy were poor rifle shots, for when we got to the top of the next hill only two had been wounded.  We all got mixed up as we advanced owing to the nature of the country and I lost sight of most of my own mates.  At this point not many of the enemy were opposed to us, although we came across many abandoned kit-bags and gear, as if they had left in a hurry. But on our left the firing was fairly heavy and continuous so the party I was with moved in that direction and we were soon in the thick of it.  By this time many British battleships had opened fire on the Turkish forts and also on the enemy artillery, their shells flying over our heads and making an awful row.  We drove the Turks back and captured four guns, many tents and ammunition, but reinforcements did not come up to us fast enough and we were forced to retire – but not for long.  The enemy took up a strong position behind the top of a hill and there were many thousands of them including many German officers.  They easily outnumbered us and had plenty of artillery and machine guns.  All we had to depend on was our rifle fire and 1 or 2 machine guns so their advantage over us was indeed great.  The fire of the enemy was absolutely murderous but our fellows advanced again and again and were dropping in all directions but would not be stopped.</p>
                <p>That Sunday the Australians proved what stuff they were made of and many a one made a hero of himself, and many a poor fellow died urging his mates onward with his last breath.  The hail of bullets was simply awful and the shrapnel shells were bursting round us all the time.  They must have expended a marvellous amount of ammunition.  Many of our officers were shot down and most of the time we got no orders at all but had to rely on ourselves and do the best we could.  At any time we did happen to see an officer the order was always the same, “Get ahead, lads, and stick it into them.”  Another advantage the Turks had over us was a thorough knowledge of the country and they had the ranges for their fire.  And I suppose they were fresh too, but we had been up all the night before, got wet coming ashore and had had no breakfast, although we had food in our haversacks but had no time to eat it.</p>
                <p>The Battalions were all mixed up and I saw very few of my own Coy..  Once I spotted Monty Woodyatt and gave him a call; he yelled out to me to come his way and we both forged ahead but got seperated almost immediately and I never saw him again.  I heard later that he had been shot dead but do not yet know if it is true. Shortly after seeing Monty I joined Geo. Thomas and Billy Money behind some bush and the bullets were raining around us thick and fast.  The cries of the wounded men about us were deadly and there were no stretcher-bearers about.  Our position became too hot for us so Bill Money and I dashed ahead; I do not know how the  bullets managed to miss us.  We kept going ahead in short rushes and soon were almost near enough to resume firing again.  As usual we were lying down behind bushes which formed a good cover but were not bullet proof. We had only been in this position a few minutes when I felt a thud in the back and afterwards found that a bullet had ripped the side of my haversack and tore a hole through a tin of “bully-beef” that I had in it.  Our haversacks were strapped to our backs for convenience.  It was a close shave but everyone was getting used to close shaves by then.</p>
                <p>You know, Mother, it might sound like skite but I’m satisfied that the old tale that a soldier nearly dies of fright when first under fire is all bosh. I heard many of our fellows say the same thing.  It makes you feel a bit uncomfortable but it also makes you want to get at the enemy and pay it all back with interest.  There was one bad point about our fellows, they were too eager and rushed ahead in any sort of order, often exposing themselves unneccessarily.  Within a minute of getting one in my haversack, I heard a groan beside me and saw Bill Money’s head drop.  We were lying at full length on our stomachs.  He said, “Ray, I’m hit” and I, with the aid of another chap who was near turned him over and got his equipment off.  When I opened out his coat and shirt there was a bullet hole showing high up on his left breast, it might have been in the shoulder blade and very little blood was coming from it.  Poor old Bill was almost unconscious and asked me if it had touched his heart.  Of course I told him that it had not and that it would be alright.  We managed to put on his “first field dressing” [one of which we all carry] and gave him a drink of water.  We made him as comfortable as possible under the circumstances and I stacked his gear in front of his head so as to stop another bullet from hitting him. All the time I was expecting to get lobbed myself for the fire of the enemy was simply hellish.  So fast and thick were the bullets coming that some of the time the sound of them was for all the world like the buzz of an electric fan – a continual hum.  We had only just got Bill fixed when another chap on the other side of me was shot through the arm.  The bullet must have cut an artery for when I cut open his sleeve the blood poured out and my hands were smothered in blood.  We bound his arm as well as we could and told him to crawl to the rear.  Two other chaps near us stopped bullets  so I thought it was time to stop attending to wounded men for it is greatly against military rules for riflemen to stop to attend to wounds. Everyone unhurt was needed in the firing line, so I had another look at Bill Money who seemed quite unconscious and then retired a little to see if I could get any stretcher-bearers but there were none about and they were yelling out for more men so I joined a few chaps who were advancing and moved up with them.  We went to the right of where I had left poor old Bill, so I did not see him again.  Later in the day one of my Company told me he had seen Bill making his way towards the beach so I am in hopes that he is getting on alright.  I would give anything to be sure of it.</p>
                <p>As we advanced the fire, if possible, became hotter but I seemed to bear a charmed life, one bullet ripped through my left coat sleeve at the wrist without touching my arm. Shortly afterwards, when lying down, my water bottle stopped one and I lost all the water, which was a serious loss indeed.  But I had a still narrower escape when a bullet tore through the collar of my tunic right under my chin.  The badge must have turned it aside for there is a dent in it and a little bit of lead sticking to it.   My collar was turned up a little for the bullet hit from the underneath side.  I am thinking of cutting it off and sending it home to you for a keepsake.</p>
                <p>It was not till about 3 p.m. that I was put out of action, when we were giving the Turks some hot fire and, of course, getting it hot in return.  Their shrapnel was very deadly and we would hear the shells go whizzing over our heads and then go off with a bang.  These shells contain hundreds of bullets and when they burst the bullets fly out.  It was a shrapnel bullet that got me. A    shell burst just a few yards to the left of me [I was lying down] and the sensation I got was as if someone had hit me with a large club full force on the muscle on the left arm.  At the same time something hit me on the right forearm and left a black bruise there. My left arm was now useless and the blood was flowing freely so I thought it was time to retire and accordingly did so, dodging bullets all the time.</p>
                <p>A few hundred yards back from the firing line I met one of our sergeants (what the hell’s the Sgt. doing there? D.B.) who put on my first field dressing.  I saw then that a bullet had gone right through my arm near the shoulder, the hole in each side being about half an inch in diameter.  I had nearly two miles to go to the beach – it was a deadly journey.  I expected to get a few more gentle reminders from the beastly Turks for stray bullets were whistling about all the time.  Anyway I got to the beach without further harm and now I am none the worse for my experience.  It was hard luck to be put out of action the first day, but still I had about ten hours of it  - and it was hot stuff,too. Some old soldiers who have been in action before say they have never seen or heard anything like it.  They say there would be nothing in France to equal it.</p>
                <p>It was a very severe day for the Australians and we suffered heavily.  Colonel Lee [who was shot through the hand] was greatly cut up and was heard to exclaim, “Oh! My poor Ninth, my poor Ninth, they will be cut to pieces, they are bearing the brunt of it all.” The scene on the beach in the afternoon was awful – the doctors and ambulance men had their hands full; wounded men were lying everywhere.  I saw George Thomas and Billy McGowan on the beach, both wounded in the shoulder, the former rather badly, I think.  Even on the beach we were not too safe for the enemy were firing on the battleships and their shrapnel was bursting over us all the time.  Unless you happened to be there you would hardly credit how marvellous were some of the escapes from death and the many different kinds of wounds showed that after all there are not many parts of the human body on which bullets prove fatal.  One chap was shot right through the head, the bullet going in about an inch behind one eye and coming out an inch behind the other. He is not much the worse for it except that he has two lovely black eyes and they are nearly closed up, but his sight is not injured.  There are many fellows with bullets still in their heads and they are doing alright.  One poor chap was struck deaf and dumb by the bursting of a shrapnel shell close over his head but was otherwise unhurt. Another fellow who had half his face blown off just coolly finished himself off with his own rifle. A mate of his was with him at the time.</p>
                <p>Dear Mother, I suppose you will think I am giving you too much of the horrors of war, but I thought you all would like to know all I could tell you about our first engagement. Here is one amusing incident to tone it down a little.  A private was lying down behind cover near the firing line when someone else dashed up and dropped down beside him.  The private noticed at once that he had no rifle so he roared at him, “What are you doing up here without a rifle you d----- fool.”  The other fellow [who happened to be an officer] just calmly replied, “Officers don’t carry rifles, you d----- fool.”  I suppose the private would feel rather small, that is, if he had time to.</p>
                <p>As quickly as possible the wounded were taken off in boats – the very bad cases going to the Hospital ship and the others to the transport ships that were lying near.  About 800 [including myself] were placed on board the Clan MacGillivary; the hospital ship was filled and two or three other troopships, so you can see there was a great number of wounded, somewhere about 5,000 I think.  It was near 5 p.m. when we boarded the Clan Mac  -  and did not leave her till this morning.  Since then we have, I mean since we went on board the Clan Mac  -  up till this morning, we have slept on the hard lower deck and lived on biscuits, cheese and jam.</p>
                <p>You know, dear Mother, we first went to Alexandria where they found there would not be room for us so only the worse cases were taken off.  The next morning after our arrival there, the “Clan Mac” turned tail with us and made for Malta.  We all growled a bit at first at being cooped up on board for a few more days but now I am glad for the climate here will be miles better than Egypt.  Mr. Thomas was taken off at Alexandria.  Capt. Jackson was wounded but he was on some other boat.  I do not think his was a bad case.  Nearly all our officers were wounded and I believe 2 or 3 were killed.</p>
                <p>Wed.,  May 5th.  The Clan Mac dropped anchor in Malta harbour early yesterday morning and after breakfast we were taken ashore in lighters drawn by steam tugs.  We are now quartered in barracks, 12 men being in each room and we are quite comfortable.  I am on the 3rd Floor and there is a lovely view of the forts and the sea on one side and of the city on the other.  We have electric light and plenty of water laid on and very convenient.  The people are very kind and gave us a warm welcome.  We are allowed to stroll about and yesterday many of us visited the English school, to the great delight of the kiddies, who seemed to think we were great heros. They pestered the life out of us for badges and foreign coins and gave us great bunches of lovely flowers.  Our room looks quite gay with the flowers I got. We had quite a gay time with the youngsters and the school mistress [who is a bosker girl] could get no work out of them for the rest of the day.</p>
                <p>Yesterday afternoon the school kids were going round with chocolates and cigarettes and also papers and magazines for the poor wounded Australians. This room in which I am writing was opened to us yesterday and paper, pens and ink supplied free – also soft drinks.  The chaplain stationed here is a fine fellow and works hard for the entertainment of the soldiers as do also many of the ladies.</p>
                <p>And now dear home folk, I hope I have not wearied you with such a long epistle – anyway I am just about at the end of my tether, but will write again soon. I have no idea how long I will be here but reckon my arm will be quite well in a fortnight or less, so if my luck is in I may be back at the front before you get this letter.  It is a long time since I had a letter and goodness knows when we are likely to get another mail.  But keep on writing for we may get them sometime or other.  I only hope you are all enjoying the best of health and continue to do so and that this letter reaches you alright.  We have been told that these letters will not be censored.  While at Alexandria I sent you a p.c. written in a hurry.</p>
                <p>Well, good-bye dear Mother, with the best of love to you all.  Hope Dad is in good nick, also the girls and Herb.  I would very much like to know if you got the news of the Australians fighting at Gallipoli and what the papers said about it.  I think we did our duty.</p>

                <h2>The "Big Push"</h2>
                <img src="../../../media/soldiers-prepare-big-push.jpg" alt="British soldiers preparing for the big push in France">
                <h3>Somewhere in France, July 30th 1916</h3>
                <p>Dear Mother,</p>
                <p>Now that we are resting after the horrors and hardships of a few days in the “Big Push” I must try and tell you some of the news.  I have sent several “field cards” and one or two short letters and hope they reached you safely.</p>
                <p>Starting from where I left off after having breakfast near Beauval, we marched on through Bonneville and billeted at the village of Halloy-Pernois, altogether a 13 mile march.  At 10.30 a.m. the next day we again started off, passed the village of Havernas and billeted at Naours, this day only a five mile tramp.  At Naours we stopped for four days having a quiet time, while there we visited some famous Catacombs less than half a mile from our billet and found them very interesting.  It was much like being down a mine only the entrance is at the base of a big hill.  These Catacombs are supposed to be 550 years old and were once chalk pits, there are passages, tunnels, dug-outs, traverses, stairways, airshafts, and ups and downs in all directions and it would be easy to get lost.  In different places there are relics of all sorts behind wire netting and bars, statues of Christ on the Cross, brass candlesticks, Virgin Mary, etc..  All over the walls persons have written their names and we saw John Norton’s who edited the “Sunday Truth”, underneath he had added “Sydney, Australia”, our guide pointed it out to us.</p>
                <p>At midday Sunday, July 16th we moved out of Naours, marched through Palmas village and billeted at a large farm on the outskirts of Rubempre.  As usual we were put into the barn to sleep and as it had been a long march we were glad to rest in the straw.  At this place food was not too plentiful, that is, other than the ordinary army rations, and one or two chaps bought all there was, leaving many of us with money in our pockets and empty tummies.  Our Sergeant was one of the lucky ones, but was foolish enough to go out and leave a hat full of cakes on his bunk and you know “opportunity makes the -----“   but I set fair exchange example by taking two cakes and putting 2 pennies in the hat and was promptly followed by others so that in about “two ups” there were more pennies than cakes.  I must draw a veil over the rest of the tale – poor Sergeant Scott.  We were two nights at this farm and then again started "foot slogging", the villages we passed through were – Herrincort, Toutencourt, Harponville and Varennes, and we stopped at Hedauville for the night.</p>
                <p>The next day our packs were collected and stowed away and we left Hedauville carrying only overcoat and oilsheet, so we knew that we were getting nearer the fray.  The whole of the 3rd Brigade were on the move and our Company rested on the outskirts of “Boozincourt” while all the Battalions marched past.  It was a great sight and you would have thought the men were going to a picnic instead of into the thickest of the fighting on the whole British Line.  That same afternoon we marched through the town of Albert and bivouaced a few hundred yards the other side. Albert is a fine large city, now almost empty of civilians and has been knocked about muchly by the Huns’ shells, especially the cathedral.  On the top of the spire is a large gilded figure of the Virgin Mary holding in her arms the form of Christ as a child.  Originally it pointed to the sky but owing to the effect of the German shells it is now leaning over at right angles – the figure itself being uninjured and it appears as if Christ was being offered to the people.  It presents a strange and curious sight, especially when standing directly underneath – to see this overhanging image a couple of hundred feet up. You may have heard of it or seen a photo of it.</p>
                <p>That night I was one of a party of twelve to go up to the firing line with some of the Coy’s gear.  It was a long and weary tramp, but we eventually, after being lost several times, found our way to Contalmaison where we left the stuff and got back to camp at 6 a.m. next morning.  I managed to get a few hours sleep and in the afternoon we all packed up and moved up as far as the old British firing line, from where the “Big Push” started.  This was Thursday, July 20th.  Here we slept for two nights and spent most of our time exploring the German’s old firing line and dug outs – the latter being in some cases 30 feet (9+ metres) underground and well furnished.  Judging by the state of the trenches and the ground round about, the Germans must have had a very hot time – their barb-wire was torn to shreds, parapets levelled to the ground, enormous shell holes overlapping each other and equipment and stores strewn everywhere in hopeless confusion.  The Pioneers and Salvage Corps had not had time to attend their work so we noticed many dead Huns about , some half buried under the ruins of their trenches, others in the open and here and there a leg or an arm sticking out of a smashed dug out.</p>
                <p>On the Saturday afternoon, after handing in our overcoats, we started for the firing line, the waggons taking our gear part of the way.  We had to carry it the rest and for nearly three hours we toiled along through communication trenches.  It was deadly work and everyone swore it was the worst time they ever had, in fact one of our chaps [Bob Wood] fainted from exhaustion.  The way was new to us, the night was dark, in places we were up to our knees in mud, had to walk over dead men and just got in to be told to get our guns in position as the attack was to start in 15 mins.  I must not tell you, dear Mother, all the horrors of that night, it would sicken you – Gallipoli was a home in comparison and for the following few days and nights it was fast and furious, attack and counter attack, dead, dying and wounded lying about, no possibility of sleep; it was indeed a shambles but how gloriously our men fought and how nobly the stretcher-bearers worked.  Many prisoners were brought in and they looked scared out of their lives.</p>
                <p>The “Big Push” is good to read of but to be in it is Hell and yet I am glad to be able to say I was there and never shirked.  Our Company suffered severely as did all the Batts. in the 1st Division.  What a great relief it was to us when we came out, both physically and mentally exhausted – the nerves of many were completely gone – it was pitiful to see big men collapse and cry like babies; we were all rather shakey but it was nothing to be ashamed of for it was a great test of human endurance.  We can look back at it now and feel glad that we were successful and we feel that next time we will do equally as well – it cannot be worse anyway,  Now we are having a good rest and I am in good health, eating like a horse and feeling fit for anything.</p>
                <p>All I have to worry about is how the dear ones at home are getting on.  Our march back from the fray was done in easy stages, via Albert, Warloy-Baillon, Vadencourt, Toulencourt, Herrisart,  Val De Maison, Naours, Halloy to Berthancourt.  I received a letter from you dated end of May yesterday, it was very welcome, glad you got the parcels I sent and hope the money is alright.  Remember me to T.W., he has my sympathy [3 oh lor].(probably the birth of his third child, oh Lord!). Will write again soon, hope you get this alright. </p></br>
                <p>Best of love, dearest of Mothers, from your loving son,</p>
                <p>Ray</p>

                <h2>Battle of Poziers</h2>
                <img src="../../../media/battle-poziers.jpg" alt="Battle at Poziers, France">
                <h3>Somewhere in France, Aug 13th 1916</h3>
                <p>Dear Herb,</p>
                <p>It is the Sabbath day and for a wonder we are having a rest so I have time to write a few lines while reclining in my billet which at some remote period was a fowl-house.  But we are accustomed to all sorts of conditions now and learn to make the best of things however severe they may be.  For some time now we have been on the move from one village to another, rarely stopping at one place for more than a few days.  We see a great deal of the country but would enjoy it more if we had less to carry.  Of course you will have read much about the Australians being in the “Big Push” but the papers could not convey any idea of the real truth of such hellish fighting as we were in at Pozieres.  I have written to Mother three times since I came out and hope the letters arrived alright, giving her some sort of an account of things. Our fellows have fought marvellously well, gaining all their objectives but at a great cost and the casualty lists, if published in the Australian papers will be a great blow to the people.  Our Division [the 1st] which was the first of the Australians to take part in the push had about 9,000 casualities and the 2nd Division suffered just as much.  For the few days we were in it, it was hell on earth, practically no sleep, little to eat and shells of all sorts and all sizes being pelted at us day and night.  Dead and wounded lay on all sides and there was blood everywhere, in one part of the trench where there had been hand to hand fighting, we noticed among the dead an Australian, his hands gripping a German by the throat while the latter had his arms around the other’s body – both were dead, had been killed by a bomb while struggling together.  The many sights we saw would make your blood curdle, they were too awful for me to describe, but there were many heroic incidents which made me feel glad that I am British.  Our bombers for instance did great work.  On the second morning of our stunt the Huns were holding a bit of trench that we wanted and they were very hard to shift, so the officer of the bombers spoke to his men, “Will we shift them, lads?”,  “Right ho, sir” was the answer and they hopped out over the parapet, 20 or 30 of them, in the face of shells and machine gun fire, raced across to the enemy trench and standing there in broad daylight they pelted their bombs with great coolness.  It was a great bit of work and we kept up machine gun fire over their heads during the scrap.  The trench was won, most of the occupants being killed, and of course, our chaps suffered too.  This is only one little incident, the stretcher bearers toiled and sweated for all they were worth under very severe conditions. Our Coy had sixteen guns in action and the only one we lost was the one I was on – the Hun’s artillery had the range to a T and lobbed over gas shells, tear shells, high explosives, shrapnel, etc. from 18 pounders to 9.2 inch.  It was “No Bon”.  Our team consisted of 5 men and 1 officer.  The officer and 1 man were wounded and 2 men killed.  It was hard luck but such things are to be expected.</p>
                <p>Well anyway, dear Herb, all that is over now and we are satisfied that things can be no worse.  The 4th Division are now in and we may relieve them soon.  At present we are at the village of Bonneville waiting for orders, having a quiet time so – what’s the use of worrying as long as we are in good health..  I hope all at home are in the best of health also, yourself and the girls. I have written to Mrs. McCathie, you will hear the news from her not included here.  I will also be writing home again soon.  Fancy you saying – “Vouley-vous promenade, mademoiselle.”  She might reply, “Oui monsier, merci.”  Tres Bon, eh?  I hope Will Raymond and family are well, give them my love and also remember me to any other friends.  Could you let me know if home affairs are settled up yet and how Mother is and the girls.  I am afraid many letters have miscarried.</p></br>
                <p>Well, hooray old chap, love to all from,</p>
                <p>Ray.</p>
                <p>We are going to win.  D.R.B.</p>

                <h2>Getting Wounded, Again</h2>
                <img src="../../../media/surgical-ward-st-john-ambulance-hospital-france.png" alt="Surgical ward run by St John Ambulance, in France">
                <h3>No. 2 Can. Gen. Hospital, France, Nov 1st 1917</h3>
                <p>Dear May,</p>
                <p>Does it surprise you to receive a letter from your humble servant and would you like to know why I have at last roused myself and found sufficient energy? Well it is because of a few pressed violets and a nice message, also Mother’s account of her stay at Sylvan Rd. while in Brisbane.  It has served to remind me of my last few days in Brisbane in 1914 when the dear old Dad was there and I visited your people – my cousins.  Little did I think then that three years would pass and still no immediate hopes are there of returning.</p>
                <p>As I lie here I have much time for reflection and the experiences of the past rise vividly before me and I live again through those joys and sorrows, good times and hard times.  And on thinking it over I come to the conclusion that on the whole I have been very lucky – for I still survive while so many of my pals have gone West and since coming to France in April 1916 I have been in all engagements  the 1st Division has taken part in.  Now I guess I am going to miss a few and I am not sorry, for having got over the worst effects of this wound I feel quite comfortable.</p>
                <p>The day I was wounded, Oct. 4th, we had advanced with six guns after the first assault of the infantry and were making positions in an old cemetery.  Everywhere the ground had been churned up by the shells and only one huge cross of rough timber remained, the rest lay smashed and broken.  At intervals about us were those battered “Pill-boxes” which had formed the Huns new system of defence.   The attack had been entirely successful and hundreds upon hundreds of prisoners were hurrying back to the rear without escort and glad enough that their fighting days were over.  Many of them were wounded and were being assisted by their comrades and some were carrying our wounded on stretchers.  The enemy artillery were shelling us all the time and many of their own men were struck down which was hard luck for them.  We were in a very exposed position but could not take cover for our guns had to be got into action, so the men were digging away for all they were worth, taking as little notice as possible of the bursting shells.  Within a quarter of an hour four of my men had been wounded and were taken back – I say “my men”, May, because I happened to be the Sergeant in charge and was supervising the mounting of the guns, the officer had retired to one of the “pill-boxes” [those solid concrete blockhouses of the Huns].  About an hour before this I had received a slight wound in the shoulder, hardly severe enough to allow me to retire, but made my arm stiff and prevented me from working.  About the worst thing to stand in war is being subjected to shell-fire while not being to do anything in return.  There we were just waiting to be shot down, it was only a matter of time, one after another was going and each man wondered as he worked when his turn would come.</p> 
                <p>My turn came as I was standing near the cross watching a couple of the lads working – there was a loud crash of a bursting shell just behind me, I felt a thud in the back and my knees gave way, I tried to speak but only a whisper came, my lung had been pierced and I could feel the blood flowing inside.  With help I managed to struggle to the nearest Pill-box where a First-Aid party were stationed.  I was placed on a stretcher after the wound was bandaged and then began the worst journey I have ever experienced in my life – over miles of torn and broken ground , shell holes, mud and water.  I just longed for someone to knock me right out.  After an hour or so I began to lose consciousness and only have a dim recollection of things.  I know I was placed in an open truck on a small railway alongside some wounded Germans and that rain started to fall – I was lying on my face all the time.  Next I remembered my wet clothes being cut off me and then – I awoke next morning in a nice clean bed with a nurse bending over me.</p>
                <p>For a few days I did not care much what happened, then my breathing began to get easier and I did not cough up so much blood and since then I have been improving daily.  But the metal is still somewhere inside and I do not know what the doctor intends to do, probably he will operate.  There, dear May, you have the whole ghastly business of my recent downfall. -     It is now nineteen months since our Division landed in France and we have taken part in the fighting on many parts of the front in northern France and Belgium.  We have had great opportunities of seeing the country, seldom stopping in one place for long, but marching day after day, sometimes for weeks at a time from village to village – coming in contact with all manner of people, seeing in the summertime miles and miles of beautiful country and acres upon acres of growing crops, well trimmed hedges of blackberry, hawthorn, etc., grasslands smothered with wildflowers, buttercups, daisies and other coloured flowers in wild profusion.  We have gazed from the summits of many a great hill at the surrounding expanse of peaceful countryside and it has been good to look at.</p>
                <p>At times we have travelled by train [generally in horse boxes] from one part of the front to another and it has been interesting to watch the ever-changing scenery – wild and rugged sometimes and at others low-lying farming districts stretching far into the distance.  No fences are to be seen and nothing to tell where one farm ends and another begins.  We have stopped in villages, towns and cities, slept in all kinds of places, barns generally but also in stables, fowl houses, warehouses, estaminets and chateaux, in tents and in the open with the sky for a roof.  In all sorts of weather, too, we have managed to jog along in full marching order from sweltering heat to extreme cold and snow a foot deep – under a blazing sun and heavy downfalls of rain and through mud and slush up to our knees.  It has indeed been a great experience and a varied one, yet we are generally very happy and none the worse for it all.</p>
                <p>There are times, you know, dear May, when we rest for a week or two in some quiet spot after being in action. The officers are easy on us then, late rising in the morning, no parades, a good canteen, football, cricket, etc., and leave to neighbouring villages or the nearest big town, concerts and pictures at night and now and again a big day of Brigade or Divisional Sports.  The latter will generally start with an “Inspection and March Past” – General Birdwood, Walker, Plumer or some other big “Brass Hat”.</p>
                <p>Will I tell you about the hard times or should I leave all that out?  Just to give you an idea of things I will try and tell you of our doings during the week before I was wounded which is generally the way of things before going into the line.  We were at the town of Steenvoide when orders came to move and those at the head of affairs, being in good humour, supplied motor-buses for the troops but we had to march about 3 miles to the starting point where the whole Brigade was lined up on the roadside.  The ride was quite enjoyable, lasting two or three hours, we started in France, crossed the border and finished up in Belgium near the village of Dickiebush.  It was getting dark then and we marched on another four miles, feeling quite tired when we reached our destination which was an open grass paddock containing many shell holes full of water.  No one seemed to know what to do, as per usual, so we sat down and waited, getting cold, feeling hungry and, sad to relate, growling and swearing.  After a while a fatigue party was called up to draw canvas shelters from some place a few hundred yards away, then we got busy and rigged our sleeping quarters.  It was quite a job, being pitch dark and in a strange place.  Later on we had tea and by ten o’clock wre able to retire for the night after mounting a gas guard.  The following morning after breakfast things had to be made ship-shape, sandbags were procured and suitable dug-outs made, our guns and gear were overhauled and belts filled. (The ammunition belts for the Vickers Machine Gun were re-usable and had to be refilled with .303 cartridges.)  That night a sergeant from each section [myself from No. 1] was told off to go up to the line to look at the positions we were to take over.  Not knowing the way we were told to wait at “Hell-fire Corner” for an officer who would accompany us.  We started out at 7.30 p.m., passed through the ruined city of Ypres and three miles the other side came to Hell-fire Corner.  But we did not wait there for that beastly corner deserves its name, so we retired a few hundred yards.  While we waited five horses and two men were killed and two men wounded at the corner by shells.  The road was thick with traffic all the time, mostly horse transport with ammunition.  Fritz was shelling all the time and blew up two ammunition dumps on the roadside.  I can tell you we were glad when the officer came along and we were able to proceed.  The walk was a long one and rough, the sides of the track were lined with dead horses and mules in various stages of decay, broken waggons and guns and debris of all kinds and a few dead men too.  Eventually we reached the positions and learned details of things in general and then began the trip back to camp about eight miles.  Fancy a sixteen mile tramp, we got to bed about 3 a.m. properly tired out but thankful enough to have got through safely.</p>
                <p>Well the next night I was politely informed that my services were required again, to guide a working party up to the line to improve the positions. I did not feel like going but of course someone had to and it was no use growling.  They were kind enough to provide motor vans for us as far as Hell-Fire Corner and we walked the remainder of the way carrying sand-bags and shovels.  Reaching the position without mishap we set to work and finished about 3 a.m. having had to stop twice and take cover from the heavy shelling.  Fritz was shelling the back area with gas-shells, that invisible stuff that can only be identified by the taste like mustard in the mouth and a slight stinging in the nostrils.  Of course we were not thinking of gas when on the way home but everyone was wearing their gas helmet in what is called the “Alert” position, ready to adjust in a few seconds, this is enforced within a certain distance of the line.  Suddenly we walked into this gas and very soon took a tumble to what it was and had our masks on in quick time.  We kept on going to get through it and were able to take off our respirators after about 5 minutes, the little we swallowed did not hurt us.  Nothing further occurred to disturb us except a few shells coming closer than they had a right to and we lobbed home just as day was breaking, tired, weary and worn, but no casualties.  Last night others had a trip up but I had a good nights rest and was glad of it.  Then the following night, Oct. 3rd., the night preceeding the attack, we all went up with our guns and gear, getting into position about 3 a.m. on the 4th..  Zero time [the time arranged for the opening of the artillery barrage] was seven minutes to six and we waited anxiously for that time to come for we were to work in co-operation with the artillery.  The night was fairly quiet, Fritz was doing most of the shelling, only a few of our big guns replying.</p>
                <p>Then, dear May, the time arrived and suddenly there was one awful roar as hundreds of guns opened up, from eighteen pounders to twelve inch, the noise was terrific and the sight was wonderful to behold, those continuous quivering flashes of light and the sound of shells rushing through the air overhead, the swish of the small ones and the large ones like railway trains tearing along.  And in the midst of it all could be heard the sharp rattle of our machine guns, fifteen yards apart over the whole front – it was indeed some barrage.  This was kept up for a couple of hours but lifting at intervals as the infantry advanced and took their objectives.  And now we are up to the point where our section of guns advanced to the old cemetery.</p>
                <p>I wonder, dear May, if you have grown tired of all this rigmarole or has it proved a little interesting, I hope the latter is the case though perhaps I have not made myself quite clear.  If you have time try and write a few lines for I would like to know how you all are.  Jack I guess will be quite a big chap now and you also will have grown out of all recognition.  Give my love to your Mother and Father, congratulations to Captain Raymond though rather late, may it soon be Major.</p></br>
                <p>Love to yourself and Jack, dear May,<p>
                <p>Your affect. cousin,</p>
                <p>Ray.</p>

                <h2>What it Takes to Win a Military Medal</h2>
                <img src="../../../media/Harrowby-camp-gun-drill.jpg" alt="Harrowby Camp, UK. Gun drill taking place">
                <h3>Harrowby Camp School, Grantham</h3>
                <p>Dear Mother,</p>

                <p>Some days ago I wrote the preceeding pages to you and have not had a chance to resume.  We are kept going at this school all day and at night have two hours writing to do in the lecture hall.  I am keeping very well but quite fed up with this sort of work and will be glad when it is over.  There are not many Australians here, it is a school for Tommies mostly with English officers at the head.</p>
                <p>We Australians are always being chipped about lax discipline, fooling, inattentiveness, strolling about with our hands in our pockets, failing to salute and numerous other petty things, but it makes little difference to our fellows, we take it all in with easy tolerance and in class work beat the Tommy every time.  They will soon take a full tumble and leave us alone.</p>
                <p>By your letters I can see that many of mine have gone astray including a very long one I wrote after the Bullecourt stunt last May telling you of that great fight of the 5th and 6th of May when we were in deadly danger of being wiped out or taken prisoner – it was for that stunt that I was awarded the Military Medal.  There was some good killing of Prussian Guards that morning of May 6th.  I was firing my machine gun at them at a range of 40 yds. – did I miss? No!</p>
                <p>My gun was knocked out and my team of men lessened by three.  I took charge of another gun which was short handed and carried on the good work but Fritz had the range  - the gun was rendered useless though not much knocked about and a few more men went West.  At this point we had to retire slightly into a side trench – the Sgt. was wounded so I took the only remaining gun and here we made what we reckoned would be our last stand.  We were hemmed in on three sides, the Huns were getting closer, coming in hundreds, our force numbered about 30 altogether – oh but they did fight;  it thrills me even now to think of that glorious fight.  We knew the German dead outnumbered ours.  The shells from both sides were ripping and tearing around us, I had no tripod for my gun but just balanced it on the top of the parapet, firing all the time whenever I could see those grim grey figures with the basin-like steel hats on their heads.  We knew it had to be a fight to a finish – win or die and we won and just as things turned in our favour I dropped from the parapet with a wound in my arm [right muscle], no longer being able to fire a gun.</p>
                <p>Reinforcements came up and our original positions were reoccupied – very few Huns got back to tell the tale.  I will not go into details of the awful slaughter and the sickening scenes of that deadly struggle – it was the hardest fighting I have yet been in. I managed to get out alright and at night was in Hospital at Etaples near the coast.</p>
                <p>It was amusing to read of your experiences with Joe on the shopping expedition, he is just the same old stick – but very good at heart always, isn’t he.  Give him my love when you write and best wishes to all the family.  I can see that Doris has not changed much, she is indeed a “brat” (I think this was Dad’s pet name for her, his youngest sister – maybe all the family used it) and must be good company for you all when at home.  I had some fine evenings with Edwin when at the O.T.B. but some-how I have lost the run of him altogether now.  A few days before I left the O.T.B. I called to see him but the room he had occupied was locked up and since then I have heard nothing of him – he may have gone to France – but anyhow Doris will know for he was always writing to her.  Geo. J. is in France again, I had a letter from him the other day written in an old German Pill-Box (usually a round concrete fortification with horizontal slits to allow the inmates to fire at the enemy with being too exposed themselves) – he was well and happy.</p>
                <p>I would like to see Ivy in my old uniform – she ought to parade at the drill – shed and try to enlist, how is Friz, I suppose he is in England somewhere, perhaps I will run across him yet.  All the girls seem to be busy at one thing or another – it is great to hear of their doings, brings home nearer to me and makes me wish I was with you all again. Getting on for four years now and still no sign of the end.  Australia will be quite strange to me when I return and all friends too.  I often think of Olga and Herb and hope by now they are settled down in a nice home of their own – my love to them and the best wishes in the world for their future happiness.  I wonder if Al is still with you or has she succeeded in obtaining a new place.  I know dear Mum you would miss her but I reckon she should try something better and not come down a penny below 3 Pounds & 10 Shillings.  Mag ought to go a bit steady, I guess she does the work of about three men, cutting hedge, rearing poultry, etc. etc..  I wonder if she would like to cut my crib (usually lunch to take to work) – sounds funny does it not?  I don’t think I would ever growl about it again, I have been through rather too much that I won’t forget, but still Mother dear I seem none the worse, just jogging along as per usual – in good health.</p>
                <p>I will not be able to write much the next few weeks while at this school but will keep you posted even if only a P.C..  Tell Dot I will answer her bonsor letter later, in the meantime she may carry on with the “garden beautiful” and keep well.  That is about all, I must go now and do my duty as a soldier and a man.  Do not worry.  I am safe in England.  Do not work too hard, please.  Love to all friends.  Best of love to you dear Mum and all at home.  Hooray.</p></br>
                <p>(There is no signature, I don’t know if Dad finished the letter like that or if Alice left it off by mistake.)<p>
