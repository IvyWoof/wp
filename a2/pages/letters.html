      <p>It is Saturday morning and nearly all our Coy. are half dead from the effects of inoculation which took place yesterday afternoon. It is absolutely deadly. It is nothing for two or three fellows to drop clean out to it while on parade without any warning whatever. We are just beginning to feel the vaccination and were inoculated on the same arm and have to wear that useful member in a sling. It effects one all over  -  head, back and everywhere else.  Just after writing home on Thursday night, the parcel of eatables was brought to me. It was just the thing and the chaps in our tent were talking of writing to Mrs. Baker and telling her what they thought of her. Fancy that. We still have some cake and coconut ice left. Yesterday was pay-day although it should have been last Monday but the pay sheet was not ready. I started an account in the Commonwealth Savings Bank, there is a branch here in camp, and I have arranged for 2/6 (Two Shillings and Six Pence) a day to be placed to my credit while we are away. We do not know when we will leave here but think it will be soon. We will all be allowed to have our vote today.  Breakfast is ready so I will close with love to you all at home.
